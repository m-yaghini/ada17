# 01 - Pandas and Data Wrangling

In this homework you will test your skills in using the Pandas library for a few basic Data Transformation and Data Wrangling tasks.
The homework consists of `3` tasks which are described in the `Homework 1.ipynb` notebook.
In order to solve these tasks, use in *read-only mode* the data folder provided in `Tutorial 02 - Intro to Pandas`.

For each exercise, please provide *both* a written explanation of the steps you will apply to manipulate the data, and the 
corresponding code. Keep in mind that writing the explanation at the beginning can help you in two ways: 1) clarifying the steps in your
mind before writing the actual code, 2) earning you points if the description is correct, regardless of the potential issues in your code.

### Deliverables
`Homework 1.ipynb` notebook with disclosed output for each cell. 

#### Deadline: October 11, 23:59
